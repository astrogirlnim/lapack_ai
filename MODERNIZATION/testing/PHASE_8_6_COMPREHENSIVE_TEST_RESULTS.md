### Root Cause Analysis

#### **1. Block-wise Implementation Overhead**
- **Fundamental flaw**: Calling DGEMM on 4×4 blocks creates more overhead than savings
- **Function call costs**: Each 4×4 block incurs DGEMM setup/teardown overhead
- **Memory management**: Block extraction and reconstruction adds latency
- **Cache inefficiency**: Multiple small DGEMM calls vs. single large operation

#### **2. Strassen-AlphaTensor Implementation Issues**
- **Theoretical vs. practical gap**: 343 operations vs. 512 standard doesn't translate to speedup
- **Implementation complexity**: Matrix partitioning and reconstruction overhead
- **Memory allocation**: Dynamic 4×4 submatrix management costs
- **Dispatch overhead**: Algorithm selection and setup latency

#### **3. Multi-Algorithm Dispatch Costs**
- **Runtime algorithm selection**: IF/ELSE logic for size-based dispatch
- **Code cache effects**: Larger binary with multiple algorithm paths
- **Optimization interference**: Compiler optimization challenges with complex control flow
- **Memory layout changes**: Multi-algorithm structure affects cache behavior

#### **4. Compiler Optimization Overhead Discovery**
- **Phase 8.5 excessive directives**: Over-optimization with `!DEC$` and `!GCC$` directives caused performance degradation
- **Register pressure**: 16 `FORCEINLINE` variables created register spillage
- **Optimization interference**: Advanced directives conflicted with compiler's auto-optimization
- **Solution implemented**: Removed excessive directives, achieved cleaner and slightly faster code

#### **5. Multi-Algorithm Fundamental Constraints**
- **Dispatch overhead**: Runtime algorithm selection costs vs. focused single-algorithm path
- **Code complexity**: Multiple optimization paths dilute focused performance benefits  
- **Memory layout**: Multi-algorithm structure affects cache behavior vs. streamlined single path
- **Context switching**: Different algorithm optimizations don't compound effectively
