# LAPACK AI Active Context - The "Now"

## Current Project Status

**Date**: January 2025  
**Phase**: Memory Bank Creation and Project Initialization

   - Mitigation: Cloud GPU instances or CPU-only development mode

2. **OpenCL Driver Stability**
   - Risk: Platform-specific OpenCL issues
   - Mitigation: Multiple platform testing, robust fallback mechanisms

3. **LAPACK Build Dependencies**
   - Risk: Complex Fortran compiler setup
   - Mitigation: Docker-based development environment

### External Dependencies
- **OpenCL Runtime**: Must be available on target systems
- **Python 3.11+**: Required for modern pybind11 features
