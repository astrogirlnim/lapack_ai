# LAPACK Modernization: 5-Day Implementation Plan (Revised with AlphaTensor)

## Project Overview
This plan modernizes LAPACK (~1.5–2M lines, Fortran 90) for data scientists and ML engineers in AI/ML pipelines, implementing six features: GPU-accelerated SVD with OpenCL, Python-friendly API, AlphaTensor’s matrix multiplication (`DGEMM_ALPHA`), performance monitoring dashboard, enhanced error handling, and Docker deployment. The AlphaTensor algorithm replaces the batched matrix multiplication feature to leverage its 10–20% speedup for 4×4 matrices, aligning with ML needs and fitting the 5-day timeline. AI tools (Claude Code, Cursor) ensure rapid development, preserving LAPACK’s numerical algorithms and delivering value (5–20x speedups, 80% setup time reduction, 50% faster debugging).

## Target User Segment
- **Audience**: Data scientists and ML engineers in AI/ML pipelines (e.g., recommender systems, PCA, transformers).
- **Pain Points**: Lack of GPU support, complex interfaces, cryptic errors, and cumbersome deployment.
- **Market Opportunity**: A LAPACK-native, vendor-agnostic, Python-accessible solution competes with cuSOLVER/MAGMA/SciPy, supported by PyTorch’s 2M+ downloads and Docker’s 14M+ pulls.

  - Verify `lapack-py` usability, dashboard (<5% overhead), error handling (1 hour).
  - Optimize Docker and generate deployment guide (2 hours).

## Key Adjustments
- **AlphaTensor Integration**: Replaces batched matrix multiplication, focusing on 4×4 matrices to simplify implementation (10–20% speedup vs. 90% cuBLAS parity).
- **Reduced Scope**: Single-GPU OpenCL, basic dashboard (key metrics only), minimal testing (core cases) to fit 5 days.
- **AI-Driven Efficiency**: AI generates 80% of code (Fortran, OpenCL, Python, Flask), optimizes kernels, and documents, saving ~10 hours.
- **Testing Focus**: Prioritize accuracy (1e-6) and core performance metrics, deferring edge-case testing.
