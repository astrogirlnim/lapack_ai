 */

/*
 * PHASE 9.1 STATUS: INFRASTRUCTURE COMPLETE
 *
 * The following components are implemented and functional:
 * - OpenCL context management and device selection
 * - C-Fortran interface following CBLAS patterns
 * - Parameter validation and error handling
 * - Comprehensive logging and debugging support
 * - Build system integration framework
 *
 * PHASE 9.2 REQUIREMENTS: KERNEL IMPLEMENTATION
 *
 * The following components need to be implemented in Phase 9.2:
 * - OpenCL kernel source code for 49 AlphaTensor operations
 * - GPU memory management and buffer allocation
 * - Host-device data transfer optimization
 * - Actual GPU computation in alphatensor_gpu_compute_4x4_internal()
 * - Batched processing implementation
 *
 * CURRENT BEHAVIOR:
 *
 * In Phase 9.1, the GPU interface functions perform:
 * - Complete parameter validation
 * - OpenCL context verification
 * - Detailed logging of operations
 * - Success return codes (no actual computation)
 *
 * This allows the hybrid variant to be built, tested, and integrated
 * with the LAPACK VARIANTS system before GPU kernels are implemented.
 *
 * INTEGRATION STRATEGY:
 *
 * The Fortran DGEMM_ALPHA_HYBRID routine can call these functions
 * and gracefully fall back to CPU implementation when:
 * - GPU is not available (alphatensor_gpu_available_() returns 0)
 * - GPU computation fails (return code != 0)
 *
 * This ensures backward compatibility and robust operation across
 * all systems, whether GPU-enabled or CPU-only.
