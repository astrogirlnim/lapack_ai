## Implementation Sequence

### Critical Path Dependencies:
1. **Phase 1A** → **Phase 1B** → **Phase 1C** → **Phase 1D**
2. **Feature 1A.1-1A.4** must complete before any analysis work
3. **Feature 1B.1-1B.4** must complete before Docker planning
4. **Feature 1C.1-1C.4** can partially overlap with analysis work
5. **Feature 1D.1-1D.4** requires all previous phases

### Daily Schedule:
- **Hours 1-2**: Complete remaining Phase 1A tasks (if any)
- **Hours 3-4**: Execute Phase 1B.1-1B.2 (LAPACK structure and DGESVD analysis)
- **Hours 5-6**: Execute Phase 1B.3-1B.4 (DGEMM analysis and AlphaTensor study)
- **Hour 7**: Execute Phase 1C (Docker Infrastructure Setup)  
- **Hour 8**: Execute Phase 1D (Documentation and Validation)

### Success Criteria:
- [x] **Working containerized development environment** (activated with single Docker command)
- [x] **Complete codebase analysis** (DGESVD/DGEMM mapped, AlphaTensor algorithm understood)
- [x] **AlphaTensor comprehension** (4×4 algorithm, 47-multiplication decomposition documented)
- [x] **Docker development and production containers** (fully functional containerized workflow)
- [x] **Comprehensive documentation** (analysis, interfaces, modernization strategy, Docker setup)
- [x] **Validated containerized foundation** (all components tested and working in containers)

### Risk Mitigation:
- **Environment Issues**: Already solved with comprehensive setup documentation
- **Analysis Complexity**: Break into focused, manageable chunks per function
- **Docker Configuration**: Start with simple dev container, iterate to production
- **Documentation Scope**: Focus on modernization-critical analysis, not exhaustive coverage
