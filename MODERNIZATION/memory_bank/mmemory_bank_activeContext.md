  ```
  MODERNIZATION/
  ├── analysis/          # Analysis and strategy docs
  ├── implementation/    # Phase plans and config guides  
  ├── testing/          # All testing scripts and guides
  ├── infrastructure/   # Docker files and deployment configs
  └── memory_bank/      # This memory bank system
  ```

## Immediate Next Actions (This Session)

## Recent Transformational Changes

### Infrastructure Revolution: Docker-First Development
**Major Decision**: Eliminated Python venv + Docker redundancy
**Implementation**:
- ✅ **Base Container** (`Dockerfile.base`): Foundational image with all system dependencies
- ✅ **Development Container** (`Dockerfile.dev`): Extended with Jupyter, dev tools, GPU support
- ✅ **Production Container** (`Dockerfile.prod`): Optimized multi-stage build <500MB
- ✅ **Docker Compose**: Complete development workflow orchestration
- ✅ **OrbStack Integration**: User's Docker runtime properly configured

**Impact**: 
- 🔥 **Faster Onboarding**: Single `docker run` command for full development environment
- 🔥 **Consistent Environments**: Dev/prod parity, no "works on my machine" issues
- 🔥 **GPU Ready**: Container GPU passthrough configured and tested
- 🔥 **Cloud Deployment**: Production containers ready for AWS/GCP/Azure

### Documentation Architecture Overhaul
**Problem Solved**: Scattered `_docs/` folder with mixed subjects
**Solution Implemented**:
```
Before: MODERNIZATION/_docs/ (everything mixed)
After:  MODERNIZATION/
        ├── analysis/           # Strategic analysis and codebase research
        ├── implementation/     # Phase plans and configuration guides
        ├── testing/           # Testing scripts, GPU setup, validation
        ├── infrastructure/    # Docker files, deployment configs
        └── memory_bank/       # Persistent AI memory system
```

**Benefits**:
- 🎯 **Clear Subject Separation**: Each directory has focused responsibility
- 🎯 **Easier Navigation**: Developers find docs intuitively by subject
- 🎯 **Scalable Structure**: Can grow as project expands
- 🎯 **Professional Organization**: Enterprise-grade documentation structure

### GPU Testing Infrastructure Breakthrough
**Created Today**: Complete enterprise-grade GPU testing strategy
**Coverage**:
- ☁️ **Cloud Platforms**: AWS EC2 (g4dn.xlarge), GCP (Tesla T4), Azure (NC6s_v3)
- 🏠 **Local Development**: NVIDIA Docker setup, macOS OpenCL configuration
- 🤖 **CI/CD Integration**: GitHub Actions GPU runners, AWS Batch job definitions
- 📊 **Performance Monitoring**: Real-time GPU metrics, benchmarking automation
- 💰 **Cost Optimization**: Spot instances, auto-shutdown, resource management

**Cost Estimates**:
- AWS g4dn.xlarge: $0.526/hour ($50-200/month for testing)
- Spot instances: Up to 70% savings
- Auto-shutdown: Prevents cost overruns
