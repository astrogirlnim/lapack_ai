# LAPACK Modernization: 5-Day Implementation Plan

## Project Overview
The Enterprise Legacy Modernization Project requires modernizing LAPACK, a numerical linear algebra library with ~1.5–2 million lines of Fortran 90 code, for data scientists and machine learning engineers in AI/ML pipelines. The six proposed features—GPU-accelerated SVD with OpenCL, Python-friendly API, batched GPU-accelerated matrix multiplication, real-time performance monitoring dashboard, enhanced error handling, and containerized deployment with Docker—address key pain points: lack of GPU support, poor Python usability, cryptic error messages, and complex deployment. This revised plan compresses the original 7-day timeline into **5 days**, leveraging AI-assisted development tools (Claude Code, Cursor) to ensure production-readiness while preserving LAPACK’s core algorithms (e.g., `DGESVD`, `DGEMM`) and delivering measurable value (5–50x performance gains, 80% setup time reduction, 50% faster debugging).

## Target User Segment
- **Audience**: Data scientists and ML engineers working on AI/ML pipelines (e.g., recommender systems, PCA, transformer models).
- **Pain Points**: Limited GPU/accelerator support, complex Fortran/C interfaces, poor error diagnostics, and cumbersome cloud deployment.
- **Market Opportunity**: A LAPACK-native solution with GPU acceleration, Python accessibility, and cloud compatibility competes with cuSOLVER, MAGMA, and SciPy, offering vendor-agnostic portability and usability.

## Revised 5-Day Timeline
The 5-day plan condenses the original 7-day schedule by combining analysis and design phases, reducing feature implementation depth (e.g., focusing on single-GPU support, simplified dashboard), and streamlining testing. AI tools are heavily utilized to accelerate coding, optimization, and documentation.

- **Simplified GPU Support**: Focus on single-GPU OpenCL for `DGESVDOCL` and `DGEMMB`, omitting multi-GPU support to reduce complexity.
- **Streamlined Dashboard**: Limit dashboard to key metrics (execution time, memory, GPU utilization) with a basic Flask UI, avoiding advanced visualizations.
- **Reduced Testing Scope**: Prioritize accuracy tests for `DGESVDOCL`/`DGEMMB` and usability tests for Python API/error handling, deferring exhaustive edge-case testing.
- **AI-Driven Efficiency**: Heavy reliance on AI tools for code generation (OpenCL kernels, Python bindings, Flask templates), optimization (block sizes, batch scheduling), and documentation to fit the compressed timeline.
